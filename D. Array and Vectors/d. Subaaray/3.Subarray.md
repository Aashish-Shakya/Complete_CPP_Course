# Subarray
It is a continuous part of an array
Array = {1, 2, 3 4,5 }
Subarrays - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
            12, 23, 34, 45,
            123, 234, 345,
            1234, 2345, 12345

Number of Subarray of an array with n element = n(n+1) / 2 
 
# How to print Subarray of an array
- we need start and end point 

Complexity  = O(n^3)

int main()
{

    int n = 5;
    int arr[n] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int st = 0; st < n; st++)
    {
        for (int end = st; end < n; end++)
        {
            for (int i = st; i <= end; i++)
            {
                cout << arr[i];
            }
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

# Subsequence
It is a sequence that can be derived an array ny selecting zero or more element, without changing the order of remaining elements.


Number of Subsequence of an array with n element = n(n+1) / 2 


- Quote - Every Subarray is a Subsequence but every Subsequence in not a Subarray
