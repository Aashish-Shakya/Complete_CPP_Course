# Introduction 
Example -> 40 students name data -> need to find name start with N -> It can be tedious but if you organize the data in alphabetical manner then it would be easy to find the required result.

# What is Data Structure?

**Data** [Any value or set of values]  +  **Structure** [Arrangement of and relation between these data]

**Data Structure** -> Way of organizing data to use effectively.

# Classification of DS

1. **Primitive DS** - Defined by language / Built-In
    - Integer
    - Real
    - Character
    - Boolean

2. **Non-Primitive DS** - Derived DS
    - **Linear DS**
        - Arrays
        - Linked List
        - Stacks
        - Queues
    
    - **Non-Linear DS**
        - Trees
        - Graphs

# Which DS Should You Use?

# Algorithm
An **algorithm** is a sequence of steps that transform the input into the output.

**Example:** Lemonade recipe

# Characteristics of an Algo.
1. **Number of solutions**
   - Example: Sorting -> Selection, Insertion, Quick Sort, etc.
2. **Practical Application** - Real-life applications
   - Example: Finding the shortest path between two points can be used in flight booking systems.

**Time and space in memory are bounded resources -> Should use wisely, and Algorithms/DS help us to do so.**

# What is Code?
A set of rules that we as programmers give to the computer for it to perform a certain task.

**Humans -> Instruction -> Machine --> Executes -> Output**  
**Instruction = Code**

# Programming Language
A **set of commands/instructions** used to communicate with the computer.

# Flowchart
A **flowchart** is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. It is a diagrammatic representation of an **algorithm**, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.

**ALGORITHM → PSEUDO CODE → FINAL PROGRAM**
