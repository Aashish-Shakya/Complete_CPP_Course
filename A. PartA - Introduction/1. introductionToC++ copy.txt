C++ is a General Purpose object oriented Programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
Extension of C language
Initially called C with Classes


** Case sensitive

# Features

    * Simple
    * fast and Powerful
    * Object Oriented
    * Compiled
    * Platform Dependent - Dependent on OS
    * Rich Lib.
 


# APPLICATIONS
    * Adobe Photoshop
    * Spotify
    * My SQL
    * Windows

# Terminologies
 * Program -> Sequence Of Statement to perform certain task
 * Programming -> Is the Creation of a Program
 * Syntax - Rules for programming Statements
 * Prog. LAng. --> Set of Symbols + rules 
 * Compiler -> Convert code to Machine Level Language(MLL) and check synatx rules
 * Subprogram --> Part of a program to perform certain task,
 * Function --> Subprogram written to promote modularity and avoid repetition


* * Every C++ Program has One and Only Main() Fuction.


Token -> Smallest Individual program unit 
     1. Special Symbols --> Mathematical,punctuation,blank space --> +, -, %, +, ?, ;, ., <, > 
     2. Word Symbols --> Always in lowercase --> Reserved words or Keywords --> int, float, return, void,
     3. Identifiers --> Names of variables, constants and functions.
                         * Consist of Letters, digit, underscore 
                         * Must begin with letter or an underscore
                         * They are case sensitive
                         * keyword can't be used as Identifiers
                     Ex-> name, Devtown, salary, hours, Ram,t_min


**  Hello world Programm

#include <iostream>
using namspace std;

int main(){
    cout<< "Helllo world" << endl;
    return 0;

}

PS C:\Complete_CPP_Course\A. PartA - Introduction> g++ helloWorld.cpp -o hello  
PS C:\Complete_CPP_Course\A. PartA - Introduction> ./hello.exe

# -> Pound sign - Every program start with this Symbols 
; - it ends the line
#include ->Anything starts with # is a directive - process by pre-processor
Tell's compiler to include ....

<iostream> - header file - contains basic c++ fn such cout, cin .../ CONTAINS DECLARATION OF ALL I/O FUCNTION
#include <iostream> --> include iostream file in this program, Here iostream is header file used for I/O

namespace -> spaces to avoid conflicts
std -->< standard

There is a namespace std which we are using in our code
using namespace std --> taking reference of iostream file. 

       If we doesn't include it then we have to write like this
        std :: cout << "" ;

int main(){} --> entry point of program --> Program Always starts executing from here, 
Here we are declaring a main function
It will return a integer value as the type is int.

return 0 ; -- return value from main fn.
Implies code executes,
it ends the main fn and after that no code is going to execute
