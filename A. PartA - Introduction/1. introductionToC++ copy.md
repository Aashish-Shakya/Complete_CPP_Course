# Introduction

C++ is a General Purpose object-oriented Programming language created by **Bjarne Stroustrup**
- Extension of C language Initially called C with Classes
- It is a Case-sensitive language   

# Features

- Simple
- Fast and Powerful
- Object-Oriented
- Compiled
- Platform Dependent - Dependent on OS
- Rich Library

# Applications
- Adobe Photoshop
- Spotify
- MySQL
- Windows

# Terminologies

- **Program** -> Sequence Of Statements to perform a certain task
- **Programming** -> The Creation of a Program
- **Syntax** - Rules for programming Statements
- **Programming Language** --> Set of Symbols + rules
- **Compiler** -> Converts code to Machine Level Language (MLL) and checks syntax rules
- **Subprogram** --> Part of a program to perform a certain task
- **Function** --> Subprogram written to promote modularity and avoid repetition

> **Note**: Every C++ Program has One and Only `main()` Function.

## Token
- Smallest Individual program unit

1. **Special Symbols**  
   - Mathematical, punctuation, blank space
   - Examples: `+`, `-`, `%`, `?`, `;`, `.`, `<`, `>`

2. **Word Symbols**
   - Always in lowercase
   - Reserved words or Keywords: `int`, `float`, `return`, `void`

3. **Identifiers**
   - Names of variables, constants, and functions.
   - **Rules**:
     - Consist of Letters, digits, underscore ` _ ` 
     - Must begin with a letter or an underscore `_`
     - They are case-sensitive
     - Keywords can't be used as Identifiers
     - Examples: `name`, `Devtown`, `salary`, `hours`, `Ram`, `t_min`

# Hello World Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### How to Compile
```
C:\hello.cpp> g++ hello.cpp -o hello  
C:\hello.cpp> ./hello.exe
```

## Explanation

### Pound sign (`#`)
- Every program starts with this symbol

### Semicolon (`;`)
- It ends the line

### `#include`
- Anything that starts with `#` is a directive processed by the pre-processor
- Tells the compiler to include the necessary files

### `<iostream>`
- Header file - contains basic C++ functions such as `cout`, `cin`
- Contains declarations of all I/O functions

### `#include <iostream>`
- It includes the `iostream` file in the program
- `iostream` is a header file used for I/O operations

### `using namespace std;`
- Avoids naming conflicts
- `std` --> standard namespace
- If not included, we need to write `std::cout << "Hello world";`

### `int main() {}`
- Entry point of every program, execution starts here
- Declares a function named `main`
- Returns an integer value as its type is `int`

### `return 0;`
- Tells the compiler that code execution ends here
- Returns a value from the `main` function
- Ends the main function and no further code is executed
