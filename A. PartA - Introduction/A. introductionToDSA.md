Example -> 40 students name data -> need to find name start with N -> It can be tedious but if you orgsnize the data in alphabetical manner the it would easy to find the required result.

# What is data structure ?

Data  [Any value or set of values]  +    Structure [Arrangement of and relation b/w these data]


Data Structure -> Way of organizing data to use effectively.


# Classification of DS.

    1. Primitive DS - Defined by lang. / Built In
        1.Integer
        2.Real
        3.Character
        4.Boolean


    2. Non-Primitive DS  - Derived DS
        1. Linear DS
            1. Arrays
            2. Linked List
            3. Stacks
            4. Queues

        2. Non-Linear DS
            1.Trees
            2. Graphs


# Which DS should you use.


# Algorithm
Is a sequence of steps that transform the input into the output.
Ex - Lemonade recipe



# Characteristics of Algorithm
1. Number of solution
ex - sorting --> Selection , insertion , quick ...
2. Practical Application  - real life
ex - Shortest path quesn/case b/w two point can be used in flight book system


** Time and space in memory a bounded resource -> Should use wisely and Algo./DS help us to do so.



## - What is a CODE ?
Set of rules that we as programmers give to computer for it to perform a certain task

Humans -> |INstruction| -> Machine --> Executes -> O/p
INstruction - Code 

# Programming Lang. -> Set of commands/instruction

# Flowchart
A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.
