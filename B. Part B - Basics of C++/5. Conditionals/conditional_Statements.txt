/*
Conditional Statement
    Also know as decision making statement, they help to take decisiions in a program on the basis of logical conditions

1. if
2. if.. else
3. if else if
4. Nested if
5. Switch Case

/*
1. IF STATEMENT 

if( condition ) {
    Block of code
}

If condition is true, Then block of code within braces will execute
 
--------------------------------------------

 
2. IF... ELSE STATEMENT 

if( condition ) {
    Bock of code 1
} else {
    Block of code 2
}

If condition is true, Then block of code within braces will execute
otherwise else part get executed
 

3. IF... ELSE IF STATEMENT 

if( condition 1 ) {
    Bock of code 1
} else if (condition 2){
    Block of code 2
} else if (condition 3){
    Block of code 3
} else {
    Block of code 4
}

---------------------------------------------

4. NESTED IF STATEMENT 

if( condition 1 ) {
    if (inner condition 1){
        inner block 1
    } else{
        inner block 2
    }
} else if ( condition 2) {
    Block of Code 2
} else {
    Block of code 3
}
 

 ----------------------------------------------

 5. SWITCH STATEMENT 

In this an expression is evaluated and the result of the expr. is used to execute a set of statement associated to that value

switch (n) {
    case 1: //Set of statement to execute if n = 1
    break;
    case 2: //Set of statement to execute if n = 2
    break;
    case 3: //Set of statement to execute if n = 3
    break;
    case 4: //Set of statement to execute if n = 4
    break;
    default: //Set of statement to execute if n matches none of above
}

If we will not use break in cases then it will execute all cases one by one
