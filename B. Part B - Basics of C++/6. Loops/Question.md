13. Write a program to print all Armstrong numbers between 100 to 500.

>   Explanation : A three digit number is called the Armstrong number if the sum of the cube of its digit is equal to
    the number itself.
    E.g.- 153 is an Armstrong number because (13)+(53)+(33) = 153.
    Sample Input : Already mentioned (100 to 500)

    Sample Output :
    0
    1
    153
    370
    371
    407



14.  Write a C++ program to check whether a Number can be expressed as a Sum of Two Prime Numbers.
>   Eg. Sample Input - Enter a +ve Integer : 14
    Sample Output –
    14 = 3 + 11
    14 = 7 + 7
