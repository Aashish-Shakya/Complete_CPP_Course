#### **ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Moderate)**
15. Find the factorial of a number  
16. Check if a number is **prime or not**  
17. Write a program to print **all prime numbers in a given range**  
18. Write a program to **display all factors of a number**  
19. Write a program to find whether a given character is a **vowel or consonant**  
20. Reverse the digits of a number (**Example: 538 â†’ 835**)  
21. **FizzBuzz Problem**  
    - Print numbers from **1 to 100**  
    - Replace multiples of **3** with `"Fizz"`  
    - Replace multiples of **5** with `"Buzz"`  
    - Replace multiples of **3 & 5** with `"FizzBuzz"`  
22. Given **2 numbers a and b**, find **a^b (a raised to the power b)**  
23. Print **Fibonacci series**  

---

#### **ðŸ”´ Advanced (Hard)**
24. Problem: Find the sum of the following series â†’ **1 - 2 + 3 - 4 ... n**  
25. Check if a given number is Armstrong or not.
25. Write a program to **display all Armstrong numbers between 100 to 500**  
    - **Example:** `153 = (1Â³) + (5Â³) + (3Â³)`  
  Explanation : A three digit number is called the Armstrong number if the sum of the cube of its digit is equal to
    the number itself.
    E.g.- 153 is an Armstrong number because (13)+(53)+(33) = 153.
    Sample Input : Already mentioned (100 to 500)

    Sample Output :
    0
    1
    153
    370
    371
    407
26. Write a **C++ program to check whether a number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers**  
    - **Example:** `14 = 3 + 11` and `14 = 7 + 7`
