## Time and Space Complexities

Complexity - Is a fn describing the efficiency of the algo in terms of the amount of data the algo must process.

1. Time Complexity -> Fn describing the amount of time an algo takes in terms of the amount of inpput to the algo.




    ## Asymptotic Analysis 
    Evaluating the performance of an algo in terms of input size.


    ***Asymptotic Notation
    The time required by an algo falls under threee types ->

    1. Best Case -> Min. time -> Noted by  Ω - Lower Bound
    2. Average Case -> Avg. time -> Noted by θ - Exact Bound
    3. Worst Case -> Max time -> Noted by O - Upper Bound


2. Space Complexity -> Fn describing the amount of memeory[space] an algo takes in terms of the amount of inpput to the algo.


 Space Complexity = Auxiiary Space + Input space
