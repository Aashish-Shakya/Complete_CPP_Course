# Complexity
The complexity of an algorithm is a function describing the efficiency of the algorithm, in term of the amount of data the alorithm must process.

## Time Complexity - 
The amount of time an algo takes 
## Space Complexity  
The amount of memory and algo take

# Why do we need Complexity analysis - an image attached
Becz Algo are platform dependednt means depends on lang used, hardware ...
So its not fare to judge the efficency of algo by just running and checking them


# Order of Growth

#Asymptotic Analysis
Evaluating the performance of an algo in terms of input size

The time required by Na Algorithm falls under 3 typed


Best Case - Min Time req for program execution - Ω
Avg Case -  Avg Time req for program execution - θ
Worst Case -  Max Time req for program execution - O
