/*
In C++ all I/O operations are performed on a sequenece of bytes called Stream.


INPUT - istream class
    bytes flow from device to main memeory
    cin --> used to get user input
    Used along with the extraction operator ( >> )
    Auto type cast input value to that variable
    For string takes input till first whitespace

    getline() ->> used to take input of whole line 

OUTPUT - ostream class
    Bytes flows from main memeory to device
    cout --> used to give output on console or other devices
    Used along with the Insertion operator ( << )

** C++ Header files for I/O
1. Iostream ->Standard I/O stream -> cin/cout/cerr..
2. Iomanip -> I/O manipulators -> Setw/setpreccision ..
3. Fstream -> Describes file stream -> handle I/O from/in files

** Keywords
cout -> output command
cin -> input command
cerr -> unbuffered standard error stream ->used to output the errors
clog ->  buffer standard error stream - used to display errors


Buffer - region in our physical memeory storage that stores data temporarily



Note - To take input of a string sentence  we can't use cin as it will take input till 1st white space character
For that we have a method known as getline()

And there is one more case which is If we input Number and String together 

All This case is explained in Video
