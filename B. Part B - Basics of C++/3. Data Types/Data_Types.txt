1BYTE == 8 BITS
Bit is the smallest unit of storage.

1 BYTE = 8 BITS4
 
DATA TYPES
--> It defines the type of data a variable can store, how much space it will occupy and what operation can be performed on it.

TYPES 
    1. Primitive Data types 
    2. Derived Data Types  
    3. User Defined Data Tyeps  
  

1. PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
--> INBUILT/by default provided by the compiler

    1. Integer
        keyword -> int
        requires 4 byte of space
      Signed  range -> -2147483648 to 2147483647  OR -2^31 TO 2^31 -1
            A. LONG --> 8 Bytes
            B. SHORT --> 2 Bytes
         
    Unsigned Range - >    2^32 -1

From 4:00


    2. Character
        keyword -> char
        requires 1 byte of space
        range -> -128 to 127 [signed char] or 0 to 255 [unsigned  char]

    3. Boolean
        keyword -> bool
        Stores either 0[false] or 1[true]
        requires 1 byte of space
         

    4. Floating point -  
        keyword -> float
        requires 4 byte of space
        Store decimal points UPTO 7 DIGIT
         
    5. Double Floating point
        keyword -> double
        requires 8 byte of space
        Store double precision floating values UPTO 15 DIGIT

    6 Void
        keyword -> void
        Has no value


2. DERIVED DATA TYPES
 --> Extension of certains data types  to achieve certain functionality

    1. Array     -> Used for storing homogenous data contiguously
    2. Pointer   -> used to store the address of a memeory location
    3. Reference -> used as a reference variable


3. User Defined/Abstract Data Types

    1. Classes -> Building block of oop
    -> Used for combining together hetrogenous data values and certain operations that can be performed on those values
    2. Structures and Unions -> Used for storing hetrogenou data together
    3. Enum -> Allows a variable to holds value from a given list of permitted values
    4. Typedef -> Allows for providing meaningful names for data types

/*
Data type Modifiers - use with primitve data type to modify the length of data

1. Signed ->, int, char
2. Unsigned -> int, char
3. Long -> int, double
4. Short -> int
